Idea #1
Our primary idea is to allow the user to input the name of an entree (or any other type of dish) they want, and in return, 
the user will obtain a list of nearby restaurants that serve this dish and a list of recipes on how to prepare the dish. 
Alternatively, the user can also just request the menu of a restaurant and click on an item on the menu to obtain the recipe. 
Our application will utilize two APIs, Edamam and Zomato, which contains data for recipes and restaurants respectively. 
Users will login using Facebook. Our database will store the user information such as saved locations, as well as past 
searches. 

Idea #2
Our secondary idea is to have a user input some pictures representing their mood and/or feelings. The items in the images will 
be analyzed using the Clarifai API to identify the main objects present in the images which we will use to choose a genre of 
music in the Spotify API playlist to recommend a certain playlist/song to the user. Users will login using Facebook. Our 
database will store user genre preferences and past searches.
