Unregistered User Creating Account:
As an unregistered user, I would like to create an account and become a registered user, and then search for an entree that 
I want. I will visit the web app’s homepage, where I will select the option to “Create Account” and make an authenticated 
account using my pre-existing Facebook login credentials. Refer to any of the search stories as the secondary step in the 
process.
